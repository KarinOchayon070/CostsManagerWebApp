Hey guys!

- This is the project we built in "Client Side Development" course.

- In this project we allow the user to manage his expenses in a smart and orderly way.

- Each user can enter information about items he purchased - such as: item name, item description, item price, item category, item purchase date, and more.

- The information is saved in "localStorage".

- Each user can issue an expense report by year and month.
